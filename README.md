# About this Example.
This is an example of how to implement GraphQL in Drupal 8.
For now the project just exposes it's published node content on the Drupal side and renders it in the React App. It does not do much more than that for now.

Further you will find a detailed explanation of how to install and have it up and running on your local machine.
