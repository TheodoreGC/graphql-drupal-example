# About this Example.
This is an example of how to implement GraphQL in Drupal 8.
For now the project just exposes it's published node content on the Drupal side and renders it in the React App. It does not do much more than that for now.

Further you will find a detailed explanation of how to install and have it up and running on your local machine.

# How to get this example project up and running (installing)

## Install composer packages (from the root of the project).
```
composer install
```

## Create an empty database.

## Install Drupal from configuration.
```
cd web/
../vendor/bin/drush site:install --existing-config
```

## If you plan to play with it - save the admin password or keep in mind that "drush uli" exists ;)

## Create some riddle nodes with a drush command that I implemented. (still from the web/ folder)
```
../vendor/bin/drush drupalup_create_content:riddle
```
## Clear Drupal's cache. This registers some of the graphql declarations (still from the web/ folder)
```
../vendor/bin/drush cr
```

## Change the REACT_APP_DRUPAL_URL with [YOUR_DRUPAL_INSTANCE_URL] in web-app/.env (after you create it)
```
cd ../web-app/
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
# Change the value of REACT_APP_DRUPAL_URL
```

## Install node packages. (still from the web-app/ folder)
```
npm install
```

## Start the React application. (still from the web-app/ folder)
```
npm start
```
## Reward your self with a cup of coffee while you are enjoying some riddles â˜•
